# Synthesis of Evidence about the Impact of Passive Voice

This repository contains the synthesis of several distinct pieces of empirical evidence about the _impact of passive voice in requirements sentences on the number of missing associations from domain models_.
This research synthesis covers three publications:

1. The original study about the impact of passive voice on the domain modeling activity[^1]
2. A reanalysis and revision of this original study[^2]
3. A revision of the reanalysis with an extended causal hypothesis[^3]

The research synthesis uses an explicit framework for evolving empirical evidence.[^4]
