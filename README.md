# Synthesis of Evidence about the Impact of Passive Voice

This repository contains the synthesis of several distinct pieces of empirical evidence about the _impact of passive voice in requirements sentences on the number of missing associations from domain models_.
This research synthesis covers three publications:

1. The original study about the impact of passive voice on the domain modeling activity[^1]
2. A reanalysis and revision of this original study[^2]
3. A revision of the reanalysis with an extended causal hypothesis[^3]

The research synthesis uses an explicit framework for evolving empirical evidence.[^4]

## Artifact Structure

The repository contains the following directories and files:

* data/ : directory containing all raw data
  * femmer-2014.csv : data from the original study[^1], originally [published](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7499290) and later [assembled](https://zenodo.org/records/10562690).
* src/ : directory containing all source code
  * evidence-evolution.Rmd : notebook demonstrating the application of the framework for evolving empirical evidence
